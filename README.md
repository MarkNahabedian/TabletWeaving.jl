TabletWeaving.jl provides a library for designing patterns for tablet
(card) weaving.  See the documentation and examples for details.

As part of this work, I needed to come up with some more rigorous
vocabulary to help me get my head around this project.

This code was originally developed in a Pluto notebook.  The change
history of that notebook can be found at
[https://github.com/MarkNahabedian/crafts/tree/migrate_tablet_weaving](https://github.com/MarkNahabedian/crafts/tree/migrate_tablet_weaving).

This document
[https://www.keithweaves.com/tablet-weaving-standard-terms-and-notation/](https://www.keithweaves.com/tablet-weaving-standard-terms-and-notation/)
provides concepts and vocabulary related to tablet weaving.
